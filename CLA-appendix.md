         Appendix to the Contributor License Agreement, v1.0
                          http://www.ifwe.co

The if(we), Inc. ("if(we)") Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") is based upon that of [Numenta](http://numenta.org/licenses/cl/numenta-cl.txt).

The Numenta CLA is itself based upon the [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).

The purpose of this document is to explain some of the differences between the if(we) CLA and the Numenta CL.

If you diff the if(we) CLA against the Numenta CL you'll find that most of the changes are nominative: We simply had to change the name of the organization to which people are contributing.

While there are several other minor changes to the Numenta CL, there are two places where the if(we) CLA diverges fairly significantly:

* The final sentence of the first paragraph of the Numenta CL has been struck from the if(we) CLA.
* The final sentence of section 3 of the Numenta CL has been struck from the if(we) CLA.

In both cases these sentences were removed on the advice of our lawyers. They advised that these sentences were either incorrect legally (in the case of the former) or were inadvisable (in the case of the latter).

if(we) welcomes feedback on the CLA document and the process surrounding it. Please raise all concerns by opening a GitHub issue on this project so the community may have a public discussion.
